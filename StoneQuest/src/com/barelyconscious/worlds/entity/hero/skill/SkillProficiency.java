 * Foresters would have higher proficiencies in woodcutting than a Miner; and vice
 * versa for Mining. Multi-classing will allow the player to choose some from a
 * pool containing both classâ€™s proficiencies. Citizens cannot progress beyond
 * Basic tier in proficiencies other than their starting proficiencies.
