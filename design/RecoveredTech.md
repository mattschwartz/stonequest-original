# Recovered Tech

Throughout the course of the game, the player will come across Recovered Tech such as old
smartphones, tablets, computers, from the 21st century. These items will give the player a sense of
the world they are exploring, providing context into the world before the apocalypse. The player
will come across these devices when going thru old cities, trash heaps, and from enemies.

These tech will often contain media: raw data, music, documents, text messages, pictures, videos,
apps, and OS's. Data extractors are required to pull media from recovered tech. The player will need
to invest in data extraction to deal with encryption and to extract deleted media. 

Text messages, pictures, and videos provide flavor for the player but also can be sold to data
collectors for a profit. Apps and OS's provide new abilities for the player, to upgrade their
VitaComm and mod their abilities. Some apps will be fun minigames for the player. Apps can be
extended and combined with other apps. Some apps don't work on certain OS's. The player will
sometimes find really good apps that require rare OS's. 

# The VitaComm Personal Device by VitaTechÂ®

VitaTech is the manufacturer of technological devices that are powered by world blood mixed with
old-world technology. The VitaComm is a personal computing device, like a more modular cellphone,
which is used by the player to interact with the tech side of Worlds. 

The main perk of using the VPD is the customizability. It comes with an upgradable motherboard,
called the *Vitaboard*, which houses a varying amount of *sockets* to which peripherals can be
attached. The Vitaboard has the following socket configurations:
1. Processor
2. Memory
3. Storage
4. Network
5. Power

Vitaboards can be found with more sockets. Peripherals can be freely swapped in and out as the
player finds better items in the world. The player will want to keep their VPD as up-to-date as
possible in order to run the best apps.  


## The Vitalink 

In the player's faction, the Vitalink exists to permanently store all media found in the world. This
is so the player doesn't have to delete media, but still has to manage it through the limitations of
the VitaComm. 


## Storage Devices

Phones, laptops, tablets. HDDs and SSDs. SD cards, and flash drives.  

## Data Extractors

When the player finds lost tech, they will take it to a data extractor to pull data from storage
devices. The data extractor will return Media items that the player can track in their VitaComm 

## Data Collectors

## Media Types
1. Text-based media: PDFs, documents, novels, text messages
2. Pictures: photos, diagrams, maps, memes
3. Videos: movies, TikToks, instructional videos
4. Apps: flashlight, map readers, photo viewers, video players
5. OS: iOS, android, etc. apps are restricted to specific OS types.

### Media Quality
1. Common. randomly generated flavor that doesn't really provide any use for the player. Only real use is to sell them to collectors.
2. Uncommon. randomly generated flavor that can grant the player new insight, like crafting xp from watching tutorials.  
3. Rare. Hand-crafted flavor that provide an insight into the world. They grant better benefits to the player and the player will like to keep them around. They can only be found once

## Open Questions

1. How do you deal with the fact that media can be copied?
    - Collectors will only buy a particular media once. 
    - Player should not find duplicates, or should get something else in exchange for searching but rolling a duplicate.
